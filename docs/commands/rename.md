# Rename an entry in the password vault.

Usage:
  `secman rename [flags]`

Examples:
  `secman rename core/docker.com`

Flags:
  **-h**, **--help**   help for rename

```code
secman rename accounts/ionic-hub
Enter new site name for accounts/ionic-hub: accounts/ionic
```

If a password is added with the wrong name it can be updated later. Here we rename ionic site after misspelling the group name.
